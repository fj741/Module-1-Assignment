        <img src="../image/John Lennon.jpg" class="profilepics" alt="John Lenon Pic">
        <p>John Lennon was born in Liverpool on October 8th 1940. 
          While he mostly played guitar, he did take-up piano in his later years. 
          When Lennon divorced previous wife (Cynthia Powell), he married Yoko Ono who, along with George Harrison's wife Linda Eastman, encouraged Lennon not to depend on the other members of the band. 
          When the Beatles broke up, Lennon continued writing music (a famous example would be the song <span>Imagine</span>) 
          Unfortunatly on December 8th 1980, John Lennon was killed outside his home but his legacy and talent will never be forgotton.  </p>

        <img src="../image/George Harrison.jpg" class="profilepics" alt="George Harrison Pic">
        <p>Similar to Lennon, George Harrison was also born in Liverpool. 
          Harrison was known as the "quiet Beatle", writing more "experimental" songs for the band including <span>Here Comes The Sun</span>, <span>While My Guitar Gently Weeps</span> and <span>Taxman</span>.
          While it was mostly band members Lennon and McCartney writing songs, each album from 1967 contained at least a couple of McCartneys work.
          Harrison was heavily inspired by Indian and Hindu traditions (as seen with the use of the sitar in many songs).
          Unfortunatly in 2001, Harrison passed away at the age of 58 from lung cancer.
