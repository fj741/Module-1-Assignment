        <p>The continuing rise in the Beatles popularity during 1963 and 1964 was dubbed <span>Beatlemania</span> by the press.
          This term was first used in 1964 when the Beatles premiered on <span>Sunday Night at the London Palladium</span> which reached over 15 million viewers.
          Later that year, the Beatles toured Australia where 300,000 Australians gathered to hear their music.
          When each Beatle recieved their <abbr title="Member of the British Empire">MBE</abbr> by the Queen outside Buckingham Palace, 4000 members of the public gathered to watch, whilst chanting "Qod save the Beatles"
          However, the Beatles grew to become sick of the overreactions by fans so they eventually split in 1970.
          Nevertheless, Beatlemania continued on a smaller scale, and to this a band has never existed that have garnered such an impact that the Beatles made.

        <p>The Beatles made their first debut on US televisions on the <span>Ed Sullivan Show</span> on Feburary 9th, 1964.
          This event was viewed by 73 million watchers, the equivilant of 34% of the entire US population.
          On Feburary 16th 1964, the Beatles made their second appearance on the <span>Ed Sullivan Show</span> which was watched by 70 million viewers.
          11 weeks after president John F Kennedy was unfortunatly assassinated, the Beatles preformed in America.
          Many believe that the Beatles helped America feel a sense of "excitemnet" once again after such a tragic event. 
          The impact of the Beatles success in America, inspired other English bands to spread their music to America.
          One of the most primary examples of this is The Rolling Stones.
